    "byAccessing": "By accessing and using the Functionality, you acknowledge that you are trading peer to peer and that One Labs is not acting as an intermediary on your behalf, or providing a regulated service, and you are not a customer of One Labs. You also acknowledge that One Labs does not provide investment advice or recommendations, and you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as One Chain are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including pursuant to Market Maker quotes or through a third-party exchange accessed via the Swapper may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or Functionality. The Site and Functionality and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more government or regulatory inquiries or government or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of One Labs to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Functionality. You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update One Labs-developed smart contracts related to the Functionality to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not reflect a binding commitment and does not in any way guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Functionality. You understand that the One Chain blockchain (and all other networks with which the Functionality may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Functionality in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the One Chain blockchain is variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on the One Chain blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Functionality. You acknowledge that the Functionality is subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or Functionality. This warning and others One Labs provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any on-going duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Functionality or accessing the Site. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Site and the Functionality, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Functionality may not be accurate, complete, error- free or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Functionality are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Functionality. All decisions that you make pursuant to pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Functionality, including trading decisions, are your own. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Functionality does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset and the use and availability of any particular blockchain. Use of the Functionality, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Functionality are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Functionality at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial (all the more so if you are leveraged). You should, therefore, carefully assess whether such trading is suitable and appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Site and Functionality, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Functionality or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Functionality, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Functionality for performing Digital Asset transactions. You understand that your private key, seed phrase and any other access credentials used to access the App must be maintained securely by you at all times and that One Labs will neither store a copy of nor be able to recover your private key or seed phrase if it is lost to you. You understand that disclosing, sharing, and/or publicly storing either your private key or seed phrase may increase your risk of loss or theft of your Wallet and/or any Digital Assets you may store in your Wallet. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your engagement with solicitations and other prompts from third parties. One Labs is a developer and supplier of software. One Labs is not a broker, nor is it a dealer or arranger, nor does it operate a Digital Asset exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and, therefore, has no oversight, involvement, or control concerning the transactions you choose to conduct via the Functionality. All transactions between users of One Labs-developed software are initiated and signed by users and are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users’ One Chain (or other network) addresses through smart contracts. You are responsible for complying with all laws that may be applicable to or govern your use of the Functionality, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and all foreign laws that apply to you and your trading. You understand that One Labs and the Swapper are not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, or any other financial regulatory authority (whether in the British Virgin Islands or elsewhere). No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the One Labs-developed software that comprises the Site and the Functionality.

One Labs is not acting as an investment manager, adviser, arranger, introducer, broker, dealer, virtual asset service provider or commodity trading adviser to any person or entity. You further understand that One Labs is not a money transmitter or money services business subject to the anti-money laundering program requirements under the Bank Secrecy Act, 31 U.S.C. 5311 et seq., or under the laws of any state or territory. You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Site and Functionality and your interaction therewith. You further expressly waive and release the One Labs Parties from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Site and Functionality and your interaction therewith.

    "pleaseReadThis": "PLEASE READ THIS “MANDATORY ARBITRATION” PROVISION VERY CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ONE LABS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND OPT-OUT OPTION SET FORTH BELOW. You and One Labs agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to your use of any of the Site or the Functionality, this Agreement, or any other controversies or disputes between you and One Labs (including, without limitation, disputes regarding the effectiveness, scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate) (collectively, “Dispute(s)”), shall be determined by arbitration, unless (A) your Country of Residence does not allow this arbitration agreement; (B) you opt out as provided below; or (C) your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below. You and One Labs further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. “Country of Residence” for purposes of this agreement to arbitrate means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the One Labs Functionality. If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence. One Labs wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against One Labs, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting One Labs at contact@Onelabs.cc to notify One Labs of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, One Labs will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the “Notifying Party”) will include in that notice (a “Notice of Dispute”) the name of User, the Notifying Party’s contact information for any communications relating to such Dispute (including for the Notifying Party’s legal counsel if it is represented by counsel in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the “Notified Party”) to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) business days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith. If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party’s compliance with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10) business days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below. If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute. We both agree to arbitrate (unless you opt out as described below). You and One Labs each agree to resolve any Disputes that are not resolved informally as described above through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, except as set forth below. If you do not wish to be subject to this agreement to arbitrate, you may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending a written notice to One Labs at contact@Onelabs.cc within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. You must date the written notice, and include your first and last name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with One Labs through arbitration. If no written notice is submitted by the 30-day deadline, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except with regard to the exceptions set forth below. By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the One Labs Service, but you and One Labs will not be permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein. You and One Labs agree that the American Arbitration Association (“ AAA “) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes in effect at the time arbitration is sought (“AAA Rules”). Those rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator. The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you hereunder in an individual lawsuit. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this paragraph, if a party seeks injunctive relief that would significantly impact other One Labs users as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall select one arbitrator, and the two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a three- person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may – if selected by either party or as the chair by the two party-selected arbitrators – participate in the arbitral panel. Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential. You and One Labs further agree that the arbitration will be held in the English language in San Francisco, California, or, if you and One Labs agree, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic means. If One Labs elects arbitration, One Labs shall pay all of the AAA filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the AAA Rules. However, if the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, One Labs will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, unless the arbitrator(s) finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). In such circumstances, fees will be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules. Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided herein or required by law. You and One Labs agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor One Labs may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “Collective Arbitration”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against One Labs will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. “Concurrently” for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR ONE LABS SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator. Notwithstanding your and One Labs’s agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or One Labs retain the right (A) to adjudicate the Dispute pursuant to the California Small Claims Act if the Dispute may be adjudicated pursuan…",
